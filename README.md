# Insurance Premium Classification

This repository contains a group project for the **Predictive Analysis** course, created to fulfill a graded component in the form of a **midterm project**.

In this project, we performed comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on a synthetic insurance dataset and built a **decision tree classification model** to classify customers into "High" or "Low" premium classes based on their profiles and historical insurance data. The decision tree models were refined using **boosting**, **pruning**, and **cross-validation** techniques.

In addition, we developed a **multiple linear regression model** to predict the exact **premium amount** for each customer. This involved techniques such as **subset selection**, **generalized linear models (GLM)**, and **regularization with cross-validation** to improve predictive performance and model robustness.

## üìä Highlights

- Performed EDA on 27 features, including 8 numerical and 18 categorical variables.
- Visualized distributions and relationships using histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and interaction plots.
- Identified key predictors using:
  - Correlation analysis for numerical features
  - ANOVA tests for categorical relationships
- Built classification models with:
  - Decision Trees (`rpart`)
  - Boosting and Pruning methods
  - Cross-validation and parameter tuning
- Built regression models using:
  - Subset selection (forward/backward)
  - GLM and regularization (e.g., ridge/LASSO via cross-validation)
- Evaluated models with:
  - Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity
  - ROC curves and AUC values
  - Mallow's Cp, BIC, and Adjusted $R^2$
